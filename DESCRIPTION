MRCS-8xDPDT-Relay - 8 channel DPDT Relay board with Arduino Relay compatible input

8 G5V2/JRC-19F/DS2E/DY2 style relays, can be powered from 5V from Arduino Relay Controller or any DC voltage coil available up to 48VDC. 
These relays are available in a wide variety of specs including waterproof and automotive.
Uses ULN-2803 as a buffer/driver and for snubber diodes.

Rev 1.1 uses the correct footprint and added cuttable pads where one contact's common (swinger) is connected to ground and the other to Relay +V. If you
want to route your own signals, just cut the track on the bottom of the board. If you leave them in, then you can use the commons as additional ground or
power connections.
