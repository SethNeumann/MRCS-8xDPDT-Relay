MRCS-8xDPDT-Relay - 8 channel DPDT Relay board with Arduino Relay compatible input

<<<<<<< HEAD
8 G5V2/JRC-19F/DS2/DY2 style relays, can be powered from 5V from Arduino Relay Controller or any DC voltage coil available up to 48VDC.
Uses ULN-2803 as buffer/driver and for snubber diodes. These relays come in various ratings including waterproof and automotive, so there is one for every appliation!

V1.2 
changed polarity of relays so it works with polarized relays
put second contact on a separate bus (from relay power) so all relays can use a signal as input to the common or you can cut the resistor pad and use
the contacts independently.
also cleaned labels up
